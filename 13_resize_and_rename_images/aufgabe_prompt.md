# Aufgabe
Use Python to convert the images in the folder to RGB format, then number the images from smallest to largest, and change the resolution of all images to a specified resolution (x, y). Save the modified folder to the given path. Then output the resolution of all images in the modified folder.

# Prompt
Your task is to generate python code to solve the following problem. The generated code must be placed between the ```python and ```, and only one code block is allowed: 
Use Python to convert the images in the folder to RGB format, then number the images from smallest to largest, and change the resolution of all images to a specified resolution (x, y). Save the modified folder to the given path. Then output the resolution of all images in the modified folder.

You need to follow the function names or class names in the test cases. The generated code should not contain any test cases: 
class Testresize_and_rename_images:
    def test_resize_and_rename_images_1(self, capsys):
        resize_and_rename_images('test1/input', 'test1/output', (800, 600))
        captured = capsys.readouterr()
        assert captured.out == "Modified images resolutions:\n001.jpg: 800 x 600\n002.jpg: 800 x 600\n003.jpg: 800 x 600\n"
