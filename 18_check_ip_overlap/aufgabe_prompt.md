# Prompt
Your task is to generate python code to solve the following problem. The generated code must be placed between the ```python and ```, and only one code block is allowed: 
write a funciton that get 4 strings indication 2 ip ranges and tell me if these ip ranges overlap or not

You need to follow the function names or class names in the test cases. The generated code should not contain any test cases: 
class Testcheck_ip_overlap:
    def test_check_ip_overlap_1(self):
        assert check_ip_overlap('192.168.1.0/24', '192.168.2.0/24') == False
